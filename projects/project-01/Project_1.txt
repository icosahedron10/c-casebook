PROJECT 1 (Weeks 1–2)
Casebook v0: Skeleton (Menu + Program Shape)

Purpose
This is the first milestone in an iterative Casebook project. The goal is to establish a clean, predictable program “shape” that all later iterations can safely build on.

Credit-hour note
This is a low-production course. Your focus here is:
- building and running reliably
- program flow that never gets “stuck”
- clear separation of responsibilities (lightweight)

You are NOT expected to build robust storage, perfect validation, or persistence in this deliverable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shared Repo Rules (applies to every project)
Repository structure
- One Git repository contains all projects.
- Each project lives in its own folder under a shared parent folder.

Recommended repo layout:
repo-root/
  Readings.txt
  Wireframes.txt
  projects/
    project-01/
    project-02/
    ...
    project-07/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites (Readings)
Week 1: Ch 1–2
Week 2: Ch 3

If you haven’t read these yet, you can still do Week 1 tasks, but Week 2 will feel confusing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What You Are Building (v0)
A terminal program that repeatedly displays a menu:

1. Add client
2. List clients
3. Quit

At v0, “clients” are conceptual:
- You MAY collect a name/contact and echo it back.
- You DO NOT need to store a database of multiple clients yet.
- You DO assign and display a next ID (starting at 1) so later versions can keep continuity.

Out of scope for Project 1
- structs
- dynamic memory (malloc/realloc)
- file persistence
- transactions
- multifile layouts / Makefiles (introduced later)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory Layout (Exact)
You must create the following directory structure:

project-01/
  README.md
  src/
    main.c

Rules
- No additional files or directories inside project-01/.
- (Repo-level files like Readings.txt/Wireframes.txt live above projects/.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create / Modify List
Create:
- project-01/README.md
- project-01/src/main.c

Modify:
- None (this is the first project)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Requirements
From the project-01/ directory, this command must succeed:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -std=c11 -g -o casebook src/main.c

Definition of done for build
- Compiles with zero warnings.

Notes
- You may add -Werror if you want extra strictness, but it is optional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run Requirements
./casebook

The program must start, display the menu, and respond to user input.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Invariants (Rules that must remain true)
These invariants will be assumed by later projects—treat them as “contracts”.

Program flow
- The program loops until the user chooses Quit.
- Invalid input must never crash the program.
- After any action (success or failure), the program returns to the menu.

ID behavior (v0 contract)
- The next client ID starts at 1.
- Each successful “Add client” increments the next ID by 1.
  - (Even though we’re not storing records yet, this establishes predictable behavior.)

Output behavior
- Menu display is consistent and easy to read.
- Error messages are short, clear, and do not spam.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week A (Week 1) — Program shape + toolchain
Goal
- You can build and run a stable menu loop.
- Each option routes to a distinct “action” block (even if it does little).

Tasks
1) Write main() with a loop:
   - print menu
   - read a choice
   - handle choice
2) Implement “Quit” cleanly.
3) Implement “Add client” and “List clients” as stubs:
   - Print “TODO: not implemented yet” or similar.
4) Basic input safety:
   - Read input in a way that won’t crash on unexpected characters.

Verification checklist
- Program never exits unexpectedly on bad input (letters, blank line, very large numbers).
- Selecting 3 quits immediately and cleanly.

Minimum viable implementation (acceptable shortcuts)
- It’s acceptable if your menu choice reading is simplistic this week.
- It’s acceptable if Add/List do not do real work yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week B (Week 2) — Basic input + add/list behavior (still minimal storage)
Goal
- Add Client does something concrete and predictable.
- List Clients provides meaningful output (even if storage is minimal).

Tasks
1) Implement line-based menu choice input:
   - Read a full line (e.g., fgets)
   - Convert to integer
   - Reject invalid choices
2) Implement Add Client (v0 level):
   - Prompt for name
   - Prompt for contact
   - Print: “Added client #<id>: <name> | <contact>”
   - Increment next ID
3) Implement List Clients (v0 level):
   Choose ONE of the following approaches:
   A) Minimal storage (recommended)
      - Store ONLY the most recently added client (name/contact) and its ID.
      - List prints either “No clients yet” or prints the single stored client.
   B) No storage (allowed)
      - List prints: “No storage in v0. Storage begins in Project 2.”
      - This is acceptable if Add Client still prints a confirmation and increments ID.

Verification checklist
- Add client works repeatedly without input getting “skipped”.
- List clients behaves deterministically.
- No buffer overflows: you always read into fixed-size buffers.

Minimum viable implementation (acceptable shortcuts)
- You may assume name/contact lines are below your max buffer size.
- You may reject overly long input by truncation (document it in README).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
README.md Requirements
Your README must include:
- What the program is (1–3 sentences)
- How to build (copy/paste command)
- How to run
- What “v0” supports (and what is explicitly out of scope)
- Known limitations (be honest; this is normal)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common Errors to Avoid
- “Input skipping” because a newline was left in the input buffer
- Infinite loops due to not changing state on invalid input
- Not checking return values from fgets/printf in critical spots
- Off-by-one mistakes on the next ID

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wireframes
None required for Project 1.

(We will start using wireframes once the project becomes multi-module or needs larger scaffolding.)
