Wireframes.txt — Casebook (Intro to C) Scaffolding Index
Version: v3 (adds WF-07A)

Purpose
This file lists OPTIONAL “wireframe sets” you can use to reduce startup time on a deliverable.
A wireframe set provides:
- file/module layout (what files exist)
- public APIs (function prototypes, structs, constants)
- responsibility notes + invariants
- TODO markers for implementation

Wireframes do NOT provide:
- full implementations
- finished algorithms
- completed parsing/report logic

How to use wireframes in this course
1) Read the relevant Project Week plan first.
2) Decide if you want scaffolding.
3) If yes, copy the wireframe set into your project folder as a starting point.
4) Implement the TODOs yourself.
5) You may modify wireframes as needed, but keep the stated invariants.

Conventions used below
- Paths are relative to a single project folder (e.g., project-07-casebook/).
- “Public API” means what other .c files are allowed to call.
- Anything marked “internal” should be static inside its .c file.

Wireframe Set Index

- WF-00: Template Set (copy/paste starter format)
- WF-06A: Multifile Split (headers + modules)
- WF-06B: Makefile Targets (baseline + asan/debug)
- WF-07A: Deterministic Reports + Fixture Runner (manual check outline) [NEW]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WF-00 — Template Set (starter format only)
(unchanged; use as a generic starter)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WF-06A — Multifile Split (Project 6 Week A)
(unchanged; defines model.h, storage.h, persistence.h, reports.h, ui.h skeletons)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WF-06B — Makefile Targets (Project 6 Week B)
(unchanged; provides Makefile shape for run/debug/asan/clean)

WF-07A — Deterministic Reports + Fixture Runner (Project 7 Week A)
Goal
- Make report output stable and comparable across runs.
- Provide a low-effort way to test against known-good datasets without building a test framework.

Part 1: Report output conventions (document + follow)
Choose a format and keep it stable. Recommended rules:
- Every report prints a heading line.
- Every row prints fields in a fixed order.
- Use integer cents consistently (no locale-dependent formatting).
- One record per line; every line ends with '\n'.
- Never rely on pointer addresses or unordered iteration that could vary.

Example heading + row shapes (illustrative)
(Use these as inspiration; finalize your own and document it in README.)

Report B (Totals by type):
TOTALS_BY_TYPE
RETAINER|<cents>
EXPENSE|<cents>
PAYMENT|<cents>

Report D (Flagged clients):
FLAGGED_CLIENTS
<client_id>|<name>|<contact>|flags=<hex_or_dec>

Key stability note
- If you must iterate, use the stored append order.
- Do NOT sort in place; if you ever sort, do it on a temporary index array (and keep it short-lived).

Part 2: Fixture-run routine (manual, deterministic)
Target layout (recommended)
data/
  fixtures/
    clients.txt
    transactions.txt
  runtime/
    clients.txt
    transactions.txt

Workflow outline
1) Reset runtime:
   - delete data/runtime/clients.txt
   - delete data/runtime/transactions.txt
2) Copy fixtures into runtime:
   - cp data/fixtures/clients.txt data/runtime/clients.txt
   - cp data/fixtures/transactions.txt data/runtime/transactions.txt
3) Build:
   - make
4) Run and execute:
   - list clients
   - list transactions
   - run all 4 reports
5) Compare output:
   - manual compare to a saved “expected output” text file OR
   - keep a short checklist of expected totals/lines in README.

Optional add-on (still low-effort)
Create an “expected output” file:
tests/
  expected_reports.txt

Then you can run:
- ./casebook < tests/demo_input.txt > tests/actual_output.txt
and manually diff them (or just eyeball).

Important
- This is NOT a full test framework.
- It’s a repeatable demo/check that catches regressions quickly.
